## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack & Architecture

This project is a showcase of modern Android development, built with a focus on scalability, testability, and a reactive UI.

### Architecture
- **Clean Architecture:** A clear separation of concerns between each layers. This makes the codebase modular, independent of frameworks, and highly testable.
- **Unidirectional Data Flow (UDF):** The UI observes a single stream of `UiState` from the ViewModel, ensuring a predictable and debuggable state management system.
